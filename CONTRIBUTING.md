# Reporting issues


# Adding an example
Each example is expected to contain
 - setup.sh: a setup file that makes all needed software and environmental variables available.
 - <example>.py: the python script to execute
 - README.md: documentation which explains what this example is about and how to run it

Optionally the example may contain:
 - `data` folder containing one or more input files no bigger than 20 MB

 If the example produces output, it has to be written to the `output` folder in
 the path of the example.
